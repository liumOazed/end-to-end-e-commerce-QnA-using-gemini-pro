## In the e-commerce businesses of the 21st century, we often encounter customers who ask repetitive and sometimes frustrating questions. This can make it challenging for our support and customer care teams, as they have to repeatedly provide the same answers, which can become quite tedious. To address this issue, I’m considering using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a set of common questions. My approach involves utilizing tools like Google’s Gemini Pro and open-source technologies such as LangChain and Python. This solution could help us provide quick, consistent, and efficient responses to our customers.
